# Week 1

[Version 1 link](https://denniswegereef.github.io/web-design-1819/version-1/)

The first week was mainly got to know what I'm suppose to do. Creating something for a blind person without is a different way of thinking. My first idea without meeting Larissa yet was to create something like a skip-to-content and skip-to-navigation buttons. Pretty simple stuff but quite helpful, a lot of websites have such small tricks build but you can't see it.

After that I was actually quite blank what I have to do than, so it was great to meet Larissa.
I notes for the session but those points were the most interesting.

- Skip to content are really easy and helpfull things
- Dropdown menu's are hard
- the NVDA screenreader is the way to go for testing
- Navigation in the HTML always on the top
- When website create dedicated websites for the phone most of the content that is not really needed gone for the user, so quite helpful for a blind person.
- Semantic HTML is nice for headings and such to quickly skim in the content of the page
- Small description of the page is a nice thing to have
- Creativity in accessibility is possible and really fun if it works
- Alt texts are only important if it gives context to the story that has to be told (leave it empty when it's just a nice image but nothing more)
- She uses a braillie keyboard mostly when she has to get exact on numbers etc.
- If she doesn't know where she is, just refresh the page and start over
- Pop-up's are stupid and hard (also iFrames)
- The NS has a nice website for accessibility.
- HTML tables are hard
- Little sounds for feedback
- The weather website is hard to use

Well that's a long list defintly with some interesting points in it.
I started thinking on first creating a better way of browsing the weather without have to look at a weather map.
But afterwards I maby thought like booking a flight is a way more fun experience to try and making it better.

Honestly I had some struggles of creating something, I coudn't really get into the idea of thinking differently (this was way way way harder than I ever thought).

# Week 2

[Version 2 link](https://denniswegereef.github.io/web-design-1819/version-2/)

Well I started building a prototype to first solve something small like a date picker, because if you wanna fly you have to know when you are going and coming back. Most of the date pickers are big tables with alot of numbers.

Things I try to improve was the fact that I set everything in a drop down from year, month and day to make it more easy searchable. It was not really a out of the box idea but it is nice just seeing how she goes over your page because what I do with the screenreader is just read every possible line there is on the page.

But when she was testing she just completely missed my introduction text, well than she just goes straight to the dropdown. So that's kinda hard, I tried to keep as limited amount of content per page. Also try to make it easy to undo a action and go back. Without having to look inside the table of days all again.

That was actually quite going well but nothing really unique, the test took just over a minute. I have some general points I should focus on for the next prototype.

- She is using a iPhone 8, also a mac and windows laptop
- She never books the flight herselfs, mostly other people do it
- A button is mostly seen as the end of a page (form)
- 1 P tag for a story, more is hard to understand there is more content
- Breadcrumbs - steps on how far your progression goes.
- Progress indicator in the audio?

Well there are some small valid points, I could defintly use for improving my date picker. I think audio sounds is a new dimension to try out. I should defintly look into that more.

# Week 3

[Version 3 link](https://denniswegereef.github.io/web-design-1819/version-3/)

Things I wanna improve this week for my prototype

- Currently selected text always possible with a hotkey possible?
- In the labels alot of content so she can't skip it :@
- Make it more personal
- More steps over different pages

I tested with Larissa and these points came out of it:

- She didn't want to change much at all, but it worked fine with showing content when needed
- Dropdowns with date are still handy
- She got through my app without using any help, so mission finished.

I still could do a-lot more nonsense, but it was harder than I thought of adding in a kinda usefull way some nonsense.
